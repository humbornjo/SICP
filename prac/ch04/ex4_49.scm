; Alyssa P. Hacker is more interested in generating interesting
; sentences than in parsing them. She reasons that by simply
; changing the procedure parse-word so that it ignores the
; "input sentence" and instead always succeeds and generates an
; appropriate word, we can use the programs we had built for
; parsing to do generation instead. Implement Alyssaâ€™s idea, and
; show the first half-dozen or so sentences generated.
