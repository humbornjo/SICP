; Write a procedure an-integer-between that returns an integer
; between two given bounds. This can be used to implement a
; procedure that finds Pythagorean triples, i.e., triples of
; integers (i, j, k) between the given bounds such that i <= j
; and i^2 + j^2 = k^2, as follows:
;
; (define (a-pythagorean-triple-between low high)
;   (let ((i (an-integer-between low high)))
;   (let ((j (an-integer-between i high)))
;     (let ((k (an-integer-between j high)))
;     (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
;     (list i j k)))))


;; Answer

(define (an-integer-between low high)
  (require (<= low high))
  (amb low (an-integer-between (+ low 1) high)))


;; Test

(load "eval_init_amb.scm")
(load "eval_separate_amb.scm")

(define test-input
  `(begin
     (define (require predicate) (if (not predicate) (amb)))
     (define (an-integer-between low high)
       (require (<= low high))
       (amb low (an-integer-between (+ low 1) high)))
     (an-integer-between 1 3)
     )
  )

(define test-got nil)
(define test-want '(3 2 1))

(ambeval test-input
         the-global-environment
         ;; ambeval success
         (lambda (val next-alternative)
           (set! test-got (cons val test-got))
           (next-alternative)
           )
         ;; ambeval failure
         (lambda () "Glorious Death"))

(assert (equal? test-got test-want))
