; Solve the following “Liars” puzzle (from Phillips 1934):
;
; Five schoolgirls sat for an examination. Their parents—so they
; thought—showed an undue degree of interest in the result. They
; therefore agreed that, in writing home about the examination,
; each girl should make one true statement and one untrue one.
; The following are the relevant passages from their letters:
;
; • Betty: “Kitty was second in the examination. I was only third.”
; • Ethel: “You’ll be glad to hear that I was on top. Joan was 2nd.”
; • Joan: “I was third, and poor old Ethel was bottom.”
; • Kitty: “I came out second. Mary was only fourth.”
; • Mary: “I was fourth. Top place was taken by Betty.”
;
; What in fact was the order in which the five girls were placed?
