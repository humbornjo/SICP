;; * Explain how a let* expression can be rewritten as a set of nested let expressions

;; - Every let will be derived into a lambda with params and then precedure call, thus
;;   with an env created, which is extended by the params. 
;;   In short, each let is called with an env created, enclosing the env of the previous
;;   one. Make it handy to build a nested let expression.


;; * If we have already implemented let (ex 4.6) and we want to extend the evaluator 
;;   to handle let*, is it sufficient to add a clause to eval whose action is
;;
;;       (eval (let*->nested-lets exp) env)
;;
;;   or must we explicitly expand let* in terms of non-derived expressions?

;; - It is sufficient.
