; Give some examples that illustrate the difference between the
; streams of Chapter 3 and the "lazier" lazy lists described in
; this section. How can you take advantage of this extra laziness?

;; Answer

;; To iter through the stream in chapter 3, we need to add delay
;; and force into the the stream construction function. And the
;; according value should be eval-ed when it is referenced.
;; However, this is not necessary for the lazy list. nothing extra
;; is needed. Alongside, the referenced value is eval-ed only when
;; it is really needed.
;;
;; For advantage, IRCC, something like GORM preload.
;;
;; var result_list []B
;; db.Table("Table_B").
;;   Preload("Table_A").
;;   Where("age > ?", 18).Find(&result_list);
