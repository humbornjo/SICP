; eval uses actual-value rather than eval to evaluate the operator
; before passing it to apply, in order to force the value of the
; operator. Give an example that demonstrates the need for this
; forcing.

;; Explain
;;
;; the question is essentially about whether the operator could
;; be thunk or not. Or further, could primitive operator be delayed?
;;
;; <delay-it> is only used in <list-of-delayed-args> in <apply>
;;
;; 1. primitive operator
;;   ('thunk (+) env)
;;   not seemingly possible
;; 2. compound operator
;;   ('thunk (func1 x y) env)
;;   see the pass below, as long as we dont trigger the primitive
;;   operator eval, thunk will be spawned and ruins the eval.
;;
;; In a word, the key point is that when the compound application
;; opperator's params is not coupled with the primitive operator,
;; thunk will be spawned, which cant be resolved by eval.
