; In the multiple dwelling problem, how many sets of assignments
; are there of people to floors, both before and after the
; requirement that floor assignments be distinct? It is very
; inefficient to generate all possible assignments of people to
; floors and then leave it to backtracking to eliminate them. For
; example, most of the restrictions depend on only one or two of
; the person-floor variables, and can thus be imposed before
; floors have been selected for all the people. Write and
; demonstrate a much more efficient non-deterministic procedure
; that solves this problem based upon generating only those
; possibilities that are not already ruled out by previous
; restrictions. (Hint: This will require a nest of let
; expressions.)
