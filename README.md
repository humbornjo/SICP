# SICP

lisp seems interesting.

# Prerequisite

**mit-scheme**
```bash
brew install mit-scheme

I really appreciate the quote MIT guys put at the end of each interpretation.

# Usage 

```
./eval.sh <FILE_NAME>
```

# Reverie
- I think I can start trying to understand knuth and latex after reading **1.3.4**
- **exercise 1.44** is really good
- "higher-order procedures enhance the power of our language by enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to reason in terms of, general methods of computation" SICP p108
- "elements is said to be closed under an operation if applying the operation to elements in the set produces an element that is again an element of the set. The Lisp community also (unfortunately) uses the word “closure” to describe a totally unrelated concept: A closure is an implementation technique for representing procedures with free variables. We do not use the word “closure” in this second sense in this book." SICP p134. Fuck c++ closure and rust closure, and all the language that use CLOSURE as the term for variable capturing.
- THe word nil is a contraction of the Latin word *nihil*, which means "nothing".
