# SICP

lisp seems interesting.

# Prerequisite

**mit-scheme**
```bash
# use mit-scheme or chicken scheme compiler

brew install mit-scheme
brew install chicken 
```

I really appreciate the quote MIT guys put at the end of each interpretation.

# Usage 

```bash
./eval.sh <FILE_NAME> # mit-scheme
csi -s <FILE_NAME>    # chicken 
```

# Reverie
- I think I can start trying to understand knuth and latex after reading **1.3.4**
- **exercise 1.44** is really good
- "higher-order procedures enhance the power of our language by enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to reason in terms of, general methods of computation" SICP p108
- "elements is said to be closed under an operation ... We do not use the word “closure” in this second sense in this book." SICP p134. Fuck c++ closure and rust closure, and all the language that use CLOSURE as the term for variable capturing.
- THe word nil is a contraction of the Latin word *nihil*, which means "nothing".
- **exercise 3.20** is good
