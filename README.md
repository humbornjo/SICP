# SICP

lisp seems interesting.

# Prerequisite

**mit-scheme**
```bash
brew install mit-scheme

```

I really appreciate the quote MIT guys put at the end of each interpretation.

# Usage 

```
./eval.sh <FILE_NAME>
```

# Reverie
- I think I can start trying to understand knuth and latex after reading **1.3.4**
- **exercise 1.44** is really good
- "higher-order procedures enhance the power of our language by enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to reason in terms of, general methods of computation" SICP p108
